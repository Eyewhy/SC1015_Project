# TO NOTE
We are only evaluating seasonals right now because I cleaned the dataset based on season, if yall really want we can add the other types back in also \
Random State is set and standardised as 42 \
also pls rmb to remove the extra models lying arnd befre submitting

## Introduction
Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) focusing on animes from 2023 Anime Dataset on Kaggle\
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset


## Problem Definition
Can we predict the score of an anime based on its attributes? \
Which variable(s) is/are the best in predicting the score of animes\
What models would be the best in predicting it? 

## Parts
  1.Data Cleaning \
  2.Exploratory Analysis \
  3.Regression \
  4.Support Vector Classification \
  5.Keras Neural Networks

## Conclusion

## What we learnt
- One-Hot Encoding
- TensorFlow Keras Neural Networks, Standardisation to reduce the range of values can improve performance of KNN models
